### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github Profile

I'm Richard and I'm a front-end web developer and educator. I have been working in the development space for over 10 years now. I primarily use React JS but as you can see from my public repos, I have a wide range of other technologies in my tech stack
